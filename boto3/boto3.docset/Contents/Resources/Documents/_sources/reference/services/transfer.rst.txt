.. py:class:: Transfer.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Transfer Family
  

  AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_server(**kwargs)

    

    Instantiates an autoscaling virtual server based on the selected file transfer protocol in AWS. When you make updates to your file transfer protocol-enabled server or when you work with users, use the service-generated ``ServerId`` property that is assigned to the newly created server.

    :type Domain: string
    :param Domain: 

    
    :type EndpointDetails: dict
    :param EndpointDetails: 

      The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make it accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IPs and make it accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.

      

    
      - **AddressAllocationIds** *(list) --* 

        A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` and it is only valid in the ``UpdateServer`` API.

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **SubnetIds** *(list) --* 

        A list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server endpoint in your VPC.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` .

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **VpcEndpointId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the VPC endpoint.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC_ENDPOINT`` .

           

        

      
      - **VpcId** *(string) --* 

        The VPC ID of the VPC in which a server's endpoint will be hosted.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` .

           

        

      
      - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

        A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to your server's endpoint.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` .

           

          You can only edit the ``SecurityGroupIds`` property in the ``UpdateServer`` API and only if you are changing the ``EndpointType`` from ``PUBLIC`` or ``VPC_ENDPOINT`` to ``VPC`` .

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type EndpointType: string
    :param EndpointType: 

      The type of VPC endpoint that you want your server to connect to. You can choose to connect to the public internet or a VPC endpoint. With a VPC endpoint, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC.

       

      .. note::

         

        It is recommended that you use ``VPC`` as the ``EndpointType`` . With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with ``EndpointType`` set to ``VPC_ENDPOINT`` .

         

      

    
    :type HostKey: string
    :param HostKey: 

      The RSA private key as generated by the ``ssh-keygen -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`` command.

       

      .. warning::

         

        If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

         

       

      For more information, see `Change the host key for your SFTP-enabled server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key>`__ in the *AWS Transfer Family User Guide* .

      

    
    :type IdentityProviderDetails: dict
    :param IdentityProviderDetails: 

      Required when ``IdentityProviderType`` is set to ``API_GATEWAY`` . Accepts an array containing all of the information required to call a customer-supplied authentication API, including the API Gateway URL. Not required when ``IdentityProviderType`` is set to ``SERVICE_MANAGED`` .

      

    
      - **Url** *(string) --* 

        Provides the location of the service endpoint used to authenticate users.

        

      
      - **InvocationRole** *(string) --* 

        Provides the type of ``InvocationRole`` used to authenticate the user account.

        

      
    
    :type IdentityProviderType: string
    :param IdentityProviderType: 

      Specifies the mode of authentication for a server. The default value is ``SERVICE_MANAGED`` , which allows you to store and access user credentials within the AWS Transfer Family service. Use the ``API_GATEWAY`` value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The ``API_GATEWAY`` setting requires you to provide an API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication using the ``IdentityProviderDetails`` parameter.

      

    
    :type LoggingRole: string
    :param LoggingRole: 

      Allows the service to write your users' activity to your Amazon CloudWatch logs for monitoring and auditing purposes.

      

    
    :type Protocols: list
    :param Protocols: 

      Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are:

       

       
      * ``SFTP`` (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH 
       
      * ``FTPS`` (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption 
       
      * ``FTP`` (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer 
       

       

      .. note::

         

        If you select ``FTPS`` , you must choose a certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) which will be used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

         

        If ``Protocol`` includes either ``FTP`` or ``FTPS`` , then the ``EndpointType`` must be ``VPC`` and the ``IdentityProviderType`` must be ``API_GATEWAY`` .

         

        If ``Protocol`` includes ``FTP`` , then ``AddressAllocationIds`` cannot be associated.

         

        If ``Protocol`` is set only to ``SFTP`` , the ``EndpointType`` can be set to ``PUBLIC`` and the ``IdentityProviderType`` can be set to ``SERVICE_MANAGED`` .

         

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type SecurityPolicyName: string
    :param SecurityPolicyName: 

      Specifies the name of the security policy that is attached to the server.

      

    
    :type Tags: list
    :param Tags: 

      Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for servers.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are metadata that you can use to search for and group a resource for various purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users, and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For example, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might create a tag called ``Group`` and assign the values ``Research`` and ``Accounting`` to that group.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name assigned to the tag that you create.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name you create.

  .. py:method:: create_user(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a user and associates them with an existing file transfer protocol-enabled server. You can only create and associate users with servers that have the ``IdentityProviderType`` set to ``SERVICE_MANAGED`` . Using parameters for ``CreateUser`` , you can specify the user name, set the home directory, store the user's public key, and assign the user's AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. You can also optionally add a scope-down policy, and assign metadata with tags that can be used to group and search for users.

      )
    :type HomeDirectory: string
    :param HomeDirectory: 

      The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.

       

      An example is * ``your-Amazon-S3-bucket-name>/home/username`` * .

      

    
    :type HomeDirectoryType: string
    :param HomeDirectoryType: 

      The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to ``PATH`` , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it ``LOGICAL`` , you will need to provide mappings in the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths visible to your users.

      

    
    :type HomeDirectoryMappings: list
    :param HomeDirectoryMappings: 

      Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will need to specify the "``Entry`` " and "``Target`` " pair, where ``Entry`` shows how the path is made visible and ``Target`` is the actual Amazon S3 path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your IAM role provides access to paths in ``Target`` . The following is an example.

       

       ``'[ "/bucket2/documentation", { "Entry": "your-personal-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]'``  

       

      In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set ``Entry`` to '/' and set ``Target`` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

       

      .. note::

         

        If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the ``s3api`` call instead of ``s3`` so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: ``aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/`` . Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a '/' for it to be considered a folder.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents an object that contains entries and targets for ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` .

        

      
        - **Entry** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Represents an entry and a target for ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` .

          

        
        - **Target** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Represents the map target that is used in a ``HomeDirectorymapEntry`` .

          

        
      
  
    :type Policy: string
    :param Policy: 

      A scope-down policy for your user so you can use the same IAM role across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ``${Transfer:UserName}`` , ``${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`` , and ``${Transfer:HomeBucket}`` .

       

      .. note::

         

        For scope-down policies, AWS Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the ``Policy`` argument.

         

        For an example of a scope-down policy, see `Creating a scope-down policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/users.html#users-policies-scope-down>`__ .

    :type Role: string
    :param Role: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The IAM role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket. The policies attached to this role will determine the level of access you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

You can apply tags to servers, users, and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For example, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might create a tag called ``Group`` and assign the values ``Research`` and ``Accounting`` to that group.

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name you create.

                
          
        
          

          - **UserCount** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies the number of users that are assigned to a server you specified with the ``ServerId`` .

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **ServerId** *(string) --* 

          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this user assigned.

          
        

        - **User** *(dict) --* 

          An array containing the properties of the user account for the ``ServerID`` value that you specified.

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user that was requested to be described.

            
          

          - **HomeDirectory** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the landing directory (or folder), which is the location that files are written to or read from in an Amazon S3 bucket, for the described user. An example is * ``your-Amazon-S3-bucket-name>/home/username`` * .

            
          

          - **HomeDirectoryMappings** *(list) --* 

            Specifies the logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will need to specify the "``Entry`` " and "``Target`` " pair, where ``Entry`` shows how the path is made visible and ``Target`` is the actual Amazon S3 path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in ``Target`` .

             

            In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set ``Entry`` to '/' and set ``Target`` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Represents an object that contains entries and targets for ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` .

              
              

              - **Entry** *(string) --* 

                Represents an entry and a target for ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` .

                
              

              - **Target** *(string) --* 

                Represents the map target that is used in a ``HomeDirectorymapEntry`` .

                
          
        
          

          - **HomeDirectoryType** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the type of landing directory (folder) you mapped for your users to see when they log into the file transfer protocol-enabled server. If you set it to ``PATH`` , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it ``LOGICAL`` , you will need to provide mappings in the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths visible to your users.

            
          

          - **Policy** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the name of the policy in use for the described user.

          - **Role** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the IAM role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket. The policies attached to this role will determine the level of access you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows a server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

            
          

          - **SshPublicKeys** *(list) --* 

            Specifies the public key portion of the Secure Shell (SSH) keys stored for the described user.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Provides information about the public Secure Shell (SSH) key that is associated with a user account for the specific file transfer protocol-enabled server (as identified by ``ServerId`` ).

                Specifies the content of the SSH public key as specified by the ``PublicKeyId`` .

                
              

              - **SshPublicKeyId** *(string) --* 

                Specifies the ``SshPublicKeyId`` parameter contains the identifier of the public key.

                
          
        
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            Specifies the key-value pairs for the user requested. Tag can be used to search for and group users for a variety of purposes.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are metadata that you can use to search for and group a resource for various purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users, and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For example, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might create a tag called ``Group`` and assign the values ``Research`` and ``Accounting`` to that group.

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name you create.

                
          
        
          

          - **UserName** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the name of the user that was requested to be described. User names are used for authentication purposes. This is the string that will be used by your user when they log in to your server.

      The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. With a VPC endpoint, you can restrict access to your server to resources only within your VPC. To control incoming internet traffic, you will need to associate one or more Elastic IP addresses with your server's endpoint.

      

    
      - **AddressAllocationIds** *(list) --* 

        A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` and it is only valid in the ``UpdateServer`` API.

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **SubnetIds** *(list) --* 

        A list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server endpoint in your VPC.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` .

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **VpcEndpointId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the VPC endpoint.

      - **VpcId** *(string) --* 

        The VPC ID of the VPC in which a server's endpoint will be hosted.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` .

           

        

      
      - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

        A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to your server's endpoint.

         

        .. note::

           

          This property can only be set when ``EndpointType`` is set to ``VPC`` .

           

          You can only edit the ``SecurityGroupIds`` property in the ``UpdateServer`` API and only if you are changing the ``EndpointType`` from ``PUBLIC`` or ``VPC_ENDPOINT`` to ``VPC`` .

           

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type EndpointType: string
    :param EndpointType: 

      The type of endpoint that you want your server to connect to. You can choose to connect to the public internet or a VPC endpoint. With a VPC endpoint, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC.

       

      .. note::

         

        It is recommended that you use ``VPC`` as the ``EndpointType`` . With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with ``EndpointType`` set to ``VPC_ENDPOINT`` .

         

      

    
    :type HostKey: string
    :param HostKey: 

      The RSA private key as generated by ``ssh-keygen -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`` .

       

      .. warning::

         

        If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

         

       

      For more information, see `Change the host key for your SFTP-enabled server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key>`__ in the *AWS Transfer Family User Guide* .

      

    
    :type IdentityProviderDetails: dict

    :type LoggingRole: string
    :param LoggingRole: 

      Changes the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon S3 events to be logged in Amazon CloudWatch, turning logging on or off.

      

    
    :type Protocols: list
    :param Protocols: 

      Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are:

       

       
      * Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): File transfer over SSH 
       
      * File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS): File transfer with TLS encryption 
       
      * File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Unencrypted file transfer 
       

       

      .. note::

         

        If you select ``FTPS`` , you must choose a certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) which will be used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

         

        If ``Protocol`` includes either ``FTP`` or ``FTPS`` , then the ``EndpointType`` must be ``VPC`` and the ``IdentityProviderType`` must be ``API_GATEWAY`` .

         

        If ``Protocol`` includes ``FTP`` , then ``AddressAllocationIds`` cannot be associated.

         

        If ``Protocol`` is set only to ``SFTP`` , the ``EndpointType`` can be set to ``PUBLIC`` and the ``IdentityProviderType`` can be set to ``SERVICE_MANAGED`` .

    :type HomeDirectory: string
    :param HomeDirectory: 

      Specifies the landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using their file transfer protocol client.

       

      An example is ``your-Amazon-S3-bucket-name>/home/username`` .

      

    
    :type HomeDirectoryType: string
    :param HomeDirectoryType: 

      The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to ``PATH`` , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it ``LOGICAL`` , you will need to provide mappings in the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths visible to your users.

      

    
    :type HomeDirectoryMappings: list
    :param HomeDirectoryMappings: 

      Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will need to specify the "``Entry`` " and "``Target`` " pair, where ``Entry`` shows how the path is made visible and ``Target`` is the actual Amazon S3 path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your IAM role provides access to paths in ``Target`` . The following is an example.

       

       ``'[ "/bucket2/documentation", { "Entry": "your-personal-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]'``  

       

      In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set ``Entry`` to '/' and set ``Target`` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

       

      .. note::

         

        If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the ``s3api`` call instead of ``s3`` so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: ``aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/`` . Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder.

         

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents an object that contains entries and targets for ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` .

        

      
        - **Entry** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Represents an entry and a target for ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` .

          

        
        - **Target** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Represents the map target that is used in a ``HomeDirectorymapEntry`` .

          

        
      
  
    :type Policy: string
    :param Policy: 

      Allows you to supply a scope-down policy for your user so you can use the same IAM role across multiple users. The policy scopes down user access to portions of your Amazon S3 bucket. Variables you can use inside this policy include ``${Transfer:UserName}`` , ``${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`` , and ``${Transfer:HomeBucket}`` .

       

      .. note::

         

        For scope-down policies, AWS Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the ``Policy`` argument.

         

        For an example of a scope-down policy, see `Creating a scope-down policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/users.html#users-policies-scope-down>`__ .
